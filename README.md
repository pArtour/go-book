# Simple Golang CRUD Book App

This is a simple CRUD book application built with the Go programming language and the Gin framework. It uses MongoDB as its database and relies on an .env file for configuration.

## Technologies Used

- Go 
- Gin 
- MongoDB

## What I Learned
- Working with the Go programming language and its standard library
- Implementing a web server with the Gin framework
- Storing and manipulating data with MongoDB
- Using an .env file to manage environment-specific configuration

## Motivation
I created this project to learn more about Go and gain experience working with a web application. It was a great opportunity to dive into the language and its ecosystem, and I hope to continue learning and building more Go projects in the future.
